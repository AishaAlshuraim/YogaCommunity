    It’s lucky Day! This 21 min integrative session is designed to bring a gentle opening to all parts of the body… and to your mind, too.
    Pro tip: use your breath.
    Today class is the ultimate brain and body yoga session. It is through this type of practice that we begin to settle into the experience of our yoga, instead of residing in our constant ambition to ‘get it right.’
    This is also the perfect elixir for our inevitably strong and ever-surfacing desire to get instant results.", url: "https://youtu.be/an4YPhQKrw0")

    Not just as a work out, but as a means of exploration for something much more.
    Shine a little light in the dark places darlin’.
    I’ll guide you.
    The hardest part is getting there.
    Resistance is normal. Extraordinary humans continue to show up.
    Overcome your resistance so that you can uncover that powerful light that is unique to you.
    Your purpose.

    I love this program because it really proves that you can get strong, toned, more flexible and stable in your body without having to push, crunch or put yourself down.
    Today’s session is a 20 minute practice to stretch, strengthen and anchor you in love.
    It is an opportunity to lovingly connect to yourself, but also to the community, and I don’t just mean Yoga With Adriene.
    Humanity.
    The world.
    Love rules.
    It starts with you.
    Chant it with me…
    Self Love Now!
    See you on the mat!
    Namaste.", url: "https://youtu.be/ClsOGe8vj9o ")
